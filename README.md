# RealRootEquationSolver

Use this only when you are sure that the equation 
has no complex roots or to find if an equation has
complex roots

# Complex roots will cause this program to be stuck.


<p>
To initialize ,you do<br \>
</p>
<div>   equation\<double\> eq;</div>
<p>
Then you call the the get_equation function
</p>
<div>  get_equation(eq); </div>
<p>
This prompts the user for necessary inputs
  
To get the solution you use  the find_roots function
which returns a vector of the roots of the equation
</p>
 <div> vector\<double\> roots=find_roots(eq); </div>
<p>  
Then you can print the roots with a loop if you want
</p>
